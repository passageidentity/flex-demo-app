# Passkey Flex Demo App

This demo is a full-stack app using Node, Express, and React to show an implementation of Passage Passkey Flex alongside a traditional password authentication.

## Getting Started
1. Run `npm i` at the root of the repository.
1. In the root of the repository create a `.env` file that contains your server port, your Passage App ID, and your Passage API Key. See `.env.example` for an example.
1. If you are running this project for the first time run `npm run setup`. This step sets up the local database the application uses.
1. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` (Or whatever port you specified in your .env file).
